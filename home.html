           <p>In this day and age, the words, great composer, in my opinion isnâ€™t associated with pop, rap, folklore or whatever your flavor, 
            I immediately think of classical music. Specifically, Bizet, Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, and Wagner to name a few. Each possesses the skills,
            passion, talent, and knowledge to become great and their music is heard far and wide and still to this day long after their passing.</p>

            <blockquote><q>
              As a musician I tell you that if you were to suppress adultery, fanaticism, crime, evil, the supernatural, 
              there would no longer be the means for writing one note.</q></blockquote>
              <p>-Bizet</p>

          <blockquote><q>
            I cannot write poetically, for I am no poet. I cannot make fine artistic phrases that cast light and shadow, for I am no painter. 
            I can neither by signs nor by pantomime express my thoughts and feelings, for I am no dancer; but I can by tones, for I am a musician.
          </q></blockquote>
          <p>-Mozart</p>

          <blockquote><q>
          Inspiration is an awakening, a quickening of all man's faculties, and it is manifested in all high artistic achievements.</q></blockquote>
          <p>-Puccini</p>

          <blockquote><q>
            I adore art...when I am alone with my notes, my heart pounds and the tears stream from my eyes, and my emotion and my joys are too much to bear.</q></blockquote>
          <p>-Verdi</p>

          <blockquote><q>
            Music is the inarticulate speech of the heart, which cannot be compressed into words, because it is infinite.</q></blockquote>
          <p>-Wagner</p>
